## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher is recommended) and `npm` or `yarn` installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine (remember to replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `shopp-e-commerce-platform` with your actual repository details):
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shopp-e-commerce-platform.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shopp-e-commerce-platform.git)
    ```

3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd shopp-e-commerce-platform
    ```

4.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    *(or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`)*

5.  Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal) to see the application live.

### Docker Deployment

1.  Make sure `docker` is installed in your system with the compose plugin.

2.  Create a directory for the project and download the `compose.yaml` file from the repository:
    ```sh
    mkdir shopp_server
    cd shopp_server
    wget https://github.com/Reddit-Clone-App-Project/Shopp_client/raw/refs/heads/main/compose.yaml
    ```

3.  Download the example .env file and edit it to include your necessary server credentials.\
    **Note:** Make sure the .env file on the host has AT LEAST read access for all users for the user inside the container to be able to read the file. You can do this with `chmod a+r .env` after editing the file.
    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/Reddit-Clone-App-Project/Shopp_client/raw/refs/heads/main/env.example
    mv env.example .env
    nano .env # edit the file then save with Ctrl+S
    ```

4.  Let Docker Compose pull the image and run the server for you:
    ```sh
    docker compose up

    # run docker compose up -d for it to be detached
    # use docker compose down to stop and remove the container
    ```
